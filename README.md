# Banking Core System (Day 1)

This project demonstrates basic banking account modelling
using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

## Concepts Covered
- Encapsulation of balance and operations
- Polymorphism via account types
- Abstract base class for extensibility

## Banking Relevance
Banks often support multiple account types with different
interest and rule sets. This design allows new account types
to be added without modifying existing logic.
